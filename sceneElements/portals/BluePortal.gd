	# Interesting to note: we cannot load PackedScene objects, because those are essentially the same as pre-loading a string. That is fine, but if we do that for both the Blue and Red portals, it won't work. That's because the Level1 has the Blue portal, which loads (and has a dependency on) SubLevel1, which has the Red portal, which in turn loads (and has a dependency) on Level1. You cannot have cylic dependencies, so we have to specify a string which is loaded in dynamically upon playtime.
